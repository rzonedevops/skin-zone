AI skin analyzers have flooded the AI skincare industry for a couple of years. The global value of this industry was [$181.2 billion in 2023](https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/beauty-personal-care/skin-care/worldwide), and it is expected to grow at [3.53% between 2025 and 2030](https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/beauty-personal-care/skin-care/worldwide). Nowadays, consumers are becoming more proactive and conscious about what products they apply to their skin and what the products contain. So, beauty and cosmetics brands must adapt to this emerging demand of consumers and try to provide effective solutions.

I have been thinking about [AI skin analyzer software](https://www.glamar.io/solutions/ai-facial-skin-analysis) since generic skincare products are taking a backseat. Now, we need personalized and tailored solutions for our skin. Instead of hiding imperfections, people have started aligning with pinpointing their skin concerns and recommended skincare routines. So, skin analysis tools are winning the deal with the combination of technology and dermatological expertise.

Therefore, it is worth spending a few days playing around with AI skin analyzer apps and tools. Focusing on their output, I have selected the 13 best apps to grow your cosmetic business and help your customers reach their beauty goals.

## What is AI skin analyzer software?

AI skin analyzer software is a part of AI skin tech. It evaluates consumers' skin health and appearance. Using AI and image processing techniques, it provides detailed insights into skin concerns like acne, pigmentation, dryness, wrinkles, etc. Besides analyzing skin conditions, consumers will get personalized skincare recommendations through this. AI skin analyzer apps are primarily categorized into two types: consumer-facing apps and professional tool apps.

Consumer-facing apps allow consumers to scan their skin and get suggestions from their devices. They can use those to track their skin progress over time. On the other hand, professionals like dermatologists and skincare brands use professional tool apps. Consumers can access AI skin analysis and [AI beauty solutions](https://www.glamar.io/solutions/makeup-virtual-try-on) through these apps, using a selfie or live camera mode.

Most importantly, it will help you know if you have skin cancer that other apps can’t detect (they claim this on their website).

Consumers can access it anytime, anywhere. It is a prediagnostic app that monitors skin health and assesses risk factors. Thus, it prevents consumers from facing unfavourable consequences and prompts them to visit the doctor quickly. By uploading a photo, consumers can get a skin analysis report in PDF form.

Skin Bliss provides personalized skin care suggestions. Consumers will get cosmetic ingredient insights that other apps can’t provide. Consumers can join ‘The Clear Your Acne Program’ and start their skincare journey with Skin Bliss using its built-in tracking and skin evaluation tools. As a skincare brand, you can add your products to this platform.

Recently, I have installed this app on my smartphone. After entering my name and date of birth, it started showing my age and how many times my skin has renewed. I appeared for its quick skin quiz and learned about my skin concerns. But, it is not as reliable as Cureskin and AI Dermatologist since health professionals do not support its suggestions.

**Features:**

A few days ago, I did my skin analysis on this app. I had to inform my skin type and tone, while other apps like Skincare Pro or Skin Bliss can detect it automatically. Then, I scanned my face and got the analysis result. Consumers can scan any of their body parts with skin concerns.

**Features:**

- **Skin analysis:** It will provide a full skin analysis report and treatment recommendations, using photos of the affected skin parts. Your customers can save or delete the report from the history.
