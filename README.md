# Skin Zone Cognitive Synergy System

This repository contains the implementation of the Skin Zone Cognitive Synergy System, a comprehensive AI-powered platform for analyzing and optimizing the skin care supply chain. The system leverages a hypergraph-based cognitive architecture to model the complex relationships between suppliers, ingredients, salons, and market trends. It integrates advanced AI capabilities, including JAX for neural computation, to enable emergent intelligence, adaptive learning, and predictive analytics.

## Key Features

*   **Cognitive Architecture**: The system is built upon a novel cognitive architecture that combines a Deep Tree Echo (right hemisphere) for novelty detection and a Marduk (left hemisphere) for metric tensor analysis. This dual-hemisphere approach allows for both creative exploration and logical reasoning.
*   **Hypergraph-based Data Model**: The core of the system is a hypergraph that represents the intricate relationships within the skin care ecosystem. This allows for a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the supply chain dynamics.
*   **JAX-powered CEO Subsystem**: The Cognitive Execution Orchestration (CEO) subsystem, powered by JAX, provides the neural computation backbone for the entire system. It enables high-performance pattern recognition, activation spreading, and emergent relationship discovery.
*   **Market Intelligence Engine**: An adaptive learning engine that continuously analyzes market data to identify trends, opportunities, and risks. It provides a real-time market health score and actionable insights.
*   **Emergent Relationship Engine**: This engine uses JAX to discover novel and emergent relationships within the hypergraph. It can predict how relationships will evolve and identify potential synergies.
*   **Self-Organizing System**: The system is designed to be self-organizing, with a Deep Tree Echo architecture that allows it to adapt and evolve over time. It can create new patterns, membranes, and cognitive structures in response to new information.
*   **Advanced Visualization Dashboard**: A comprehensive and interactive dashboard that provides a real-time view into the cognitive system. It includes visualizations for the membrane hierarchy, pattern network, activation flows, and more.

## Components

### Backend (Python)

*   `ceo_subsystem.py`: The JAX-based Cognitive Execution Orchestration (CEO) subsystem.
*   `market_intelligence_engine.py`: The adaptive market intelligence engine.
*   `emergent_relationship_engine.py`: The emergent relationship discovery engine.
*   `self_organizing_system.py`: The self-organizing system with Deep Tree Echo architecture.

### Frontend (React)

*   `CognitiveSystemDashboard.jsx`: The main dashboard that integrates all the cognitive components.
*   `AdaptiveLearningDashboard.jsx`: The dashboard for the market intelligence engine.
*   `PredictiveAnalyticsDashboard.jsx`: The dashboard for the emergent relationship engine.
*   `AdvancedVisualizationDashboard.jsx`: The advanced visualization dashboard for the self-organizing system.
*   `EnhancedHypergraphVisualization.jsx`: The enhanced hypergraph visualization component.
*   `RealTimeDataPipeline.jsx`: The real-time data pipeline component.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    # For the backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # For the frontend
    cd skin-zone-app
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the backend**:

    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    python ceo_subsystem.py
    python market_intelligence_engine.py
    python emergent_relationship_engine.py
    python self_organizing_system.py
    ```

3.  **Run the frontend**:

    ```bash
    # From the skin-zone-app directory
    npm run dev
    ```

## Deployment

## Future Work

*   Integrate a real-time data pipeline to stream live market data into the system.
*   Expand the hypergraph to include more entities and relationships.
*   Develop more sophisticated predictive models for market trends and supply chain disruptions.
*   Enhance the self-organizing capabilities of the system to allow for more autonomous evolution.
