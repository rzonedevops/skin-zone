Commodity ingredients like stearic acid and potassium sorbate remain cost-effective at under $15/kg. Specialty bioactive ingredients like Snow Mushroom Complex are positioned in the mid-premium range at $144.95/kg.

### Platform Pricing Trends
Salon and spa management platforms have standardized around three pricing tiers, with entry-level plans starting at $24-30/month, mid-tier plans at $48-56/month, and enterprise plans at $148-168/month.
